# How I plan to tackle jQuery:
- I am going to use the Pomodoro Technique (I have been meaning to try this out) and try to compartmentalize my time into 25 min chunks with a 5 min break in between the chunks.
- I am going to keep all my resources in my Quiver notebooks.
- I want to build something in order to learn, possibly a page that describes what each thing does and shows an example of how it works. Research shows that project-based learning is the best way to retain knowledge, and I will be creating something that I can come back to later and review. ALSO, creating a page will help me to remember HTML.
- I am going to combine the 2 hours that I have to research and make into 2hrs 45mins of learning; I am doing this because "making a thing" is the way that I learn best, and separating them is not my favorite way to go.

##Resources
- I will start with a Google search about learning jQuery
- I will try to find resources that show what jQuery can do better than vanilla JavaScript and begin my research there.
- Stack Exchange is a good place to find answers to any questions I may have, but I won't be using that until I have found some concrete resources that get me started.


##What Worked:
- Most of what I planned on doing worked; I was able to find some resources for how to add jQuery to a page and a bunch of examples of what jQuery can do. 
- I began adding jQuery to my HTML page, but forgot to add it to my quiver notebook at the same time because I was "In the zone", so I need to go back and write some notes regarding how jQuery works.

##Where I got stuck:
- At a certain point, I didn't know what else to do!
- I decided to stop researching and talk with another DBC student about jQuery and what they found out because another perspective is always helpful to have when you are stuck.
