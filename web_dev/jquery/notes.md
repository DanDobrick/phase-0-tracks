# How I plan to tackle jQuery:
- I am going to use the Pomodoro Technique (I have been meaning to try this out) and try to compartmentalize my time into 25 min chunks with a 5 min break in between the chunks.
- I am going to keep all my resources in my Quiver notebooks.
- I want to build something in order to learn, possibly a page that describes what each thing does and shows an example of how it works. Research shows that project-based learning is the best way to retain knowledge, and I will be creating something that I can come back to later and review. ALSO, creating a page will help me to remember HTML.
- I am going to combine the 2 hours that I have to research and make into 2hrs 45mins of learning; I am doing this because "making a thing" is the way that I learn best, and separating them is not my favorite way to go.

##Resources
- I will start with a Google search about learning jQuery
- I will try to find resources that show what jQuery can do better than vanilla Javascript and begin my research there.
- Stack Exchange is a good place to find answers to any questions I may have, but I won't be using that until I have found some concrete resources that get me started.
